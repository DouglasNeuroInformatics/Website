Dr. Maxime Montembeault, Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University and researcher at the Douglas Research Centre, is leading an innovative project to develop and validate digital cognitive tests for aging and dementia. The project uses [Open Data Capture](https://opendatacapture.org/en/), and several tasks have already been carried out to produce the tools needed for the research.

The main objective is to create easy-to-use digital tests, including a multimodal emotion recognition test and an adaptive image naming test. These tools aim to facilitate the early differential diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorders, taking advantage of technological advances to offer more accurate and accessible assessment methods.

The project also seeks to assess the associations between the structural and functional integrity of the brain and performance on each test. This approach is part of a growing trend to use artificial intelligence and digital technologies to improve the detection and monitoring of age-related cognitive disorders.

By developing these new digital cognitive tests, Dr. Montembeault's team aims to contribute to earlier and more accurate detection of cognitive disorders, paving the way for earlier and better-targeted interventions.
